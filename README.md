## Introduction

Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility, making predicting prices a challenging yet intriguing task. CryptoPredictor employs machine learning techniques to make price predictions based on historical data. The project is implemented in Python using the scikit-learn library for modeling and visualization.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KannurAnudeepRaj/CryptoPredictor-ML.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd CryptoPredictor-ML
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the necessary historical cryptocurrency data in a CSV file. Update the `crypto_data.csv` file with your dataset.

2. Run the `CryptoPredictor.py` script:

   ```bash
   python CryptoPredictor.py
   ```

3. Review the console output for training and testing Mean Squared Error.

4. View the generated visualization comparing actual vs. predicted prices.

## File Structure

- `CryptoPredictor.py`: The main Python script containing the machine learning model and visualization.
- `crypto_data.csv`: Placeholder file for your historical cryptocurrency data.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## Documentation

### Data Loading

The project uses the `load_data()` function to load historical cryptocurrency data from a CSV file. Ensure your data is properly formatted with columns like 'timestamp', 'price', 'volume', etc.

### Data Preprocessing

The `preprocess_data()` function can be customized to handle missing data, outliers, or any specific preprocessing steps required for your dataset.

### Feature Engineering

The `engineer_features()` function allows you to create relevant features such as moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc., based on your analysis.

### Model Training and Evaluation

The `train_evaluate_model()` function uses the RandomForestRegressor for training and evaluates the model using Mean Squared Error on both training and testing sets.

### Visualization

The `visualize_results()` function generates a visualization comparing actual and predicted prices over time. Adjust this section based on your preferred plotting techniques.
